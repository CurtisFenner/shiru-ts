		// and "not literal".
		// `literalAntecedent` indicates the clause within which "literal" is a
		// unit clause; `negativeLiteralAntecedent` indicates the same for
		// "not literal".

		// This method must "diagnose" the conflict, producing a new clause
		// which rejects previous "decisions".

		// The simplest diagnosis is to reject the entire set of decision
		// currently in the assignment stack. However, some of those decisions
		// may not be relevant to this particular conflict; generating a more
		// general conflict clause will prune more of the remaining search
		// space.

		// The `antecedentClause` mapping can be used to generate an
		// "implication graph". The vertices of the graph are literals.
		// For non-decision variables, an edge exists for the negation of each
		// other literal in the vertex's selected antecedent clause.

		// This implication graph structure indicates that a vertex is _implied_
		// by the conjunction of all predecessor vertices. A vertex with no
		// precedessors is a "decision variable", and had a truth value selected
		// arbitrarily.

		// The problem of "diagnosing" a conflict is determing a set of vertices
		// which transitively imply the conflicting the two conflicting
		// literals.

		// To drive backtracking solely by conflict clauses, the conflict clause
		// should be an "asserting clause" -- one which will be a unit clause
		// after unassigning all decisions mentioned in the conflict. This means
		// it must have only one literal from the latest decision level.

		// The simplest method is "rel_sat": resolve all literals in the current
		// decision level except the decision variable:
